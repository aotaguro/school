This project is based of OMEGA mart, a tv show called Severance, the password game, and THERE IS NO GAME
All html and css was mainly open sourced with a surprising amount of editing and some changes for preference done by me 
- All javascript written by me with some tutorials and instructions on things I don't know. I  relied on ai to understand code that deals with linking html and special css effects
-I tried to implement things we learned like lists, functions, loops, and more
